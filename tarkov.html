                    <h1>What is Escape from Tarkov?</h1>
                    <p>
                      Escape from Tarkov is a hardcore and realistic online first-person action RPG/Simulator with MMO features and a story-driven walkthrough.</p>
                    <p>
                      With each passing day the situation in the Norvinsk region grows more and more complicated. Incessant warfare in Tarkov has sparked massive panic; the local population has fled the city, but those who stayed are looking to improve their fortunes at the expense of others. Having accepted the new reality, savage Tarkov locals - "Scavs" flocked into well-armed gangs and started the redivision of the city. Nowadays, Tarkov is separated by unseen borders, controlled by different groups. Gain-greedy gunmen would go to any length to have their way, including the murder of civilians and direct confrontation with the two private military companies.</p>
                    <p>  
                      The players will have to experience living in the skin of one of the mercenaries who survived the initial stage of the Tarkov conflict. After choosing one of the sides – USEC or BEAR – the player’s character starts to make his way out of the city. Tarkov is sealed off by UN and Russian military, supply chains are cut, communication with operational command is lost, and in these conditions everyone has to make his own choices of what to do and how to get out of the chaos-ridden metropolis.                    </p>

                    <h1>How is the gameplay</h1>
                    <p>PMC: The player uses their main character, entering the raid with gear equipped by the player. Once in raid, the player can pick up any gear from dead players, dead AI[3], as well as loot from loot spawn locations such as filing cabinets, bags, safes and computer tower blocks. If a PMC dies, the player drops everything that is equipped or stored on the player with the exception of the items in the secure container. In order to survive and extract with any gear they picked up, players have to make it to an extraction point. Extraction points are assigned at the beginning of a raid and some require certain conditions to be met (such as Customs Vehicle Exit requiring a payment of 7000 roubles per person extracting, or the 'Cliff Descent' extract requiring the player to be carrying a paracord and a climbing ice pick).</p>
                    <p>Scav: The player can also go into a raid as Scav, the AI faction, with a random set of gear and equipment. Scav AI will start off as neutral to a Scav player, but often other players have also entered the raid as a Scav. Scavs will face off against PMCs and potentially other Scav players. Any loot gathered by the player as a Scav can be transferred to the main character, while dying as a Scav has no penalty aside from lost gear. In order to survive and extract with any gear you picked up, Scav players must also use extraction points, which may sometimes be exclusive to scavs. If a player Scav shoots a fellow Scav, they will defend themselves and nearby Scavs will become hostile to them.</p>
                    <p>Offline Mode: Using the same maps as the PMC mode, players can enter a sandbox mode for testing; any gear, loot, experience and actions in the offline mode will be reversed at the end of the raid. Ammo expended, gear found or lost, or player injuries will be reset. Players can also modify the raid conditions, which include, but are not limited to, weather and AI skill and aggression.</p>

                  </figure>
                    <p>Player Hideout: Includes building and upgrading of various facilities in the hideout, each with its own bonuses such as player recovery and the manufacture of items such as ammunition and loot. Hideouts also provide the ability to upgrade the player's stash size (not relevant to EoD players), along with the capability to produce various items.</p>
